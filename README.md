Hi, Iâ€™m @woodenpythonï¼Œ a student from China.  I recently developed interest in Python and Pygame,
and have already read the basic tutorial for them. I would like to initiate my first project to construct
a game, and in the mean time share the whole process here on Github. I am not actually sure whether I can 
really complete this chanllenge, but at least the passion is enough for now to keep me going. Wish me luck
and a good adventure!
